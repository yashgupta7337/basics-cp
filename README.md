# 📝 Basics of Competitive Programming

Welcome to **Basics-CP** — my personal repository for learning and practicing **competitive programming (CP)**.  
This repo serves as my **notebook, playground, and codebase** as I explore the world of algorithmic problem-solving — often called the **“mind sport” of programming.”**
